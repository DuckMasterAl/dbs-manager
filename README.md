This bot was made for a Discord Bot Shop owned by me a while ago. This code is bad and **heavily** outdated.

If you want a good ticket bot check out the [Quacky Support Bot.](https://github.com/quacky-bot/quacky-support)

This just became a public archive for anyone that may want it as a resource, but should **not** be used as a stand alone bot.

It's also to see how far I've grown as a bot developer :)
